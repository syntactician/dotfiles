## E. Hern√°ndez's Dotfiles
This is my attempt at synchronizing my dotfiles across several machines. If you happen to like or have questions about anything you see here (especially the i3 or vim configs) feel free to [hit me up](mailto:ehernandez@email.wm.edu).


### Todo

#### Sync configs
- write .gitignore for ~
- replace dotfiles repo

#### Implement

#### Fix
